This throws up a complicated conundrum when it comes to solar marketing ideas. Is it a case of those who already know, already have, and those who don\u2019t, don\u2019t want?<\/p>\n<p>If so, what does effective solar lead generation look like? How can you be part of the movement to ensure that more consumers are hit by the rays of solar growth? Most importantly, are there marketing strategies in place that are particularly relevant to the needs of the solar industry?<\/p>\n<p>The quick answer is that a select number of digital marketing strategies have proven to be effective across the board, no matter which industries adopt them. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sureoak.com\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">White Hat SEO<\/a> is still the most effective way to drive organic traffic and generate leads that matter\u2014and it can be effectively employed in any sector.<\/p>\n<p>But, like most things, the devil lies in the details.

Here they are\u20149 ways to capture your piece of the sun through digital lead generation and solar advertising.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"fusion-clearfix\"><\/div><\/div><\/div><div class=\"fusion-layout-column fusion_builder_column fusion-builder-column-2 fusion_builder_column_1_1 1_1 fusion-one-full fusion-column-first fusion-column-last\" style=\"margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:20px;\"><div class=\"fusion-column-wrapper fusion-flex-column-wrapper-legacy\" style=\"background-position:left top;background-repeat:no-repeat;-webkit-background-size:cover;-moz-background-size:cover;-o-background-size:cover;background-size:cover;padding: 0px 0px 0px 0px;\"><div class=\"fusion-text fusion-text-2\"><h2>The Top 9 Solar Lead Generation and Marketing Ideas<\/h2>\n<h3>1. Formulate industry-specific Solar Marketing Ideas<\/h3>\n<p>Having a look at the statistics of energy alternatives, it\u2019s not hard to see that solar is on the rise in comparison to other players.<\/p>\n<p>Added to this, incentive schemes are being employed throughout the globe that are only set to increase the uptake. This means that if environmental concerns are not a major factor in consumer decision-making, financial implications will be. The U.S. Department of Energy has set up <a href=\"https:\/\/www.energy.gov\/eere\/solarpoweringamerica\/solar-powering-america\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Solar Powering America<\/a>, which provides incentives to both individuals and businesses.<\/p>\n<p>While the industry is undoubtedly on the rise, it is currently navigating some very real growing pains.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to solar advertising, the greatest challenge lies in an industry that, while growing rapidly, is somewhat betwixt and between. This means that you cannot simply adopt a blanket marketing strategy that is copy-pasted from other industries. You need to get specific.<\/p>\n<p>You can only do this by understanding the unique characteristics of solar lead generation and marketing.<\/p>\n<p>Which brings us to our next point.<\/p>\n<h3>2. Know that Solar Lead Generation Companies Must Cross the Chasm<\/h3>\n<p>Sometimes booms hurt a little.<\/p>\n<p>Very broadly speaking, there have historically been two types of people who have solar installed in their homes:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Those who adopted decades ago<\/li>\n<li>Those who were referred by those who adopted decades ago<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Up until very recently, mass adoption was a pipe dream. The result is, we currently reside between two paradigms\u2014the first of fringe adoption, and the second of mass adoption. <a href=\"https:\/\/news.energysage.com\/best-solar-leads-2017\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">A report by EnergySage<\/a> has identified the current moment by referencing author <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.ca\/Crossing-Chasm-Marketing-High-Tech-Mainstream\/dp\/0060517123?tag=ca-skim1x176764-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Geoffrey Moore\u2019s notion of \u201ccrossing the chasm\u201d<\/a>, an effective means of describing the tightrope between a climate of only early adopters and one of accepted standard practice.<\/p>\n<p>While this \u201cchasm\u201d is exciting to cross, it\u2019s a complex time for marketers, as it puts much of the onus on them to ensure that mass adoption indeed comes about. Marketers have to work that much harder to generate as many leads as possible and make sure that they are reaching the right people for long-term growth.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, as we will see in our next point, generating leads is sometimes easier said than done.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Make Solar Lead Generation a Top Priority<\/h3>\n<p><img class=\"lazyload size-full wp-image-16363 alignright\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%27400%27%20height%3D%27400%27%20viewBox%3D%270%200%20400%20400%27%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%27400%27%20height%3D%27400%27%20fill-opacity%3D%220%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E\" data-orig-src=\"https:\/\/www.sureoak.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/solar-lead-generation.jpg\" alt=\"solar-lead-generation\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" \/>It may come as no surprise to you that according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/marketing-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hubspot\u2019s report on the state of inbound marketing<\/a>, 68% of respondents agreed that <a href=\"\/insights\/how-to-use-seo-to-generate-traffic-and-convert-leads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">generating traffic and leads<\/a> was their company\u2019s greatest marketing challenge. Added to this, 80% of marketers stated that their lead generation efforts were only slightly or somewhat effective. (BrightTALK, 2015) Wow. Look, we\u2019re no Scientists, but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8iYdJH1i4rc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">in the words of a band that may need some sun themselves,<\/a> \u201cNobody said it was easy. No one ever said it would be this hard.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>There is good news though\u2014through hard, intelligent work and a focus on long-term solar marketing strategies, effective lead generation is possible. In fact, the reason our company centers around SEO is that we have found it to be the most effective means of generating leads that not only serve to bring in new clientele in the short term, but also ensure they keep coming in down the line.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Put a strong referral system in place<\/h3>\n<p>As we have mentioned, the solar industry has typically survived off a referral system. Your neighbor installs solar, you chat, then so do you. The next step is to take this kind of referral system into the digital world.<\/p>\n<p>This can operate in various ways. The first is to make sure you have strategies in place to capture good reviews of your work and display them clearly on your homepage. The second is the modern day equivalent of a referral system\u2014<a href=\"\/insights\/link-building-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">link building<\/a>. If you can get authoritative sources to link to your company\u2019s work, you immediately up your credibility. It\u2019s the digital equivalent of word of mouth, and it works like a dream in solar marketing.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Favor education over advertising<\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that people do not want to be constantly advertised at. So much so that, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/marketing-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hubspot<\/a>, 4 out of 5 people have left a webpage because of a pop-up or autoplaying ad.<\/p>\n<p>So here\u2019s the deal. Don\u2019t inundate people with adverts. Rather, provide them with meaningful content that will serve to educate them about the benefits of solar installation. Make it concise and informative. This will be your greatest asset when it comes to generating traffic and getting people to engage with your business.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Use videos to garner trust and display your work<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"\/insights\/social-media-video-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Videos work<\/a>. It\u2019s often as close as you can get to meet a contractor before they begin work on your property. What\u2019s more, videos can serve as a moving brochure for your work. By displaying some of your previous projects, you will be able to illustrate that you are a trustworthy supplier that has completed jobs successfully.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Intelligent keyword research<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, <a href=\"\/insights\/keyword-analysis-optimization-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">keyword research<\/a> is necessary for all sectors who would like to launch or maintain a successful digital marketing campaign. What makes solar marketing different is that it is important to make provisions for people who don\u2019t necessarily know they are looking for solar until they find it. This is one of the key characteristics of a market about to boom\u2014you have to show people what they want before they know they are looking for it.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Don\u2019t buy solar leads from a vendor<\/h3>\n<p>We won\u2019t dwell on this one. Just don\u2019t do it. Numerous solar lead generation companies offer lists of leads at a pretty penny. These leads are very often outdated, irrelevant, and filled with the names of people who simply don\u2019t want to be called by you. Don\u2019t fall into the trap.<\/p>\n<p>Instead&#8230;<\/p>\n<h3>9. Master the SERPS<\/h3>\n<p>If you can <a href=\"\/insights\/getting-on-first-page-google\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">get your company to the top of a Search Engine Results Page<\/a> (SERP) through ethical means that take into the account the core mandates of the major search engines, you\u2019ve struck marketing gold for the following reasons:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The effort it takes to get there means that it will be incredibly difficult to be usurped by your competitors<\/li>\n<li>Once you are on Page 1, any other marketing strategies that you employ will be bolstered by your positioning.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.business2community.com\/brandviews\/shelley-media-arts\/70-seo-statistics-prove-power-search-01946881\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Between 70 and 80% of people simply skip past paid ads<\/a> and go straight for organic results.<\/li>\n<li>Being seen as an authoritative source, particularly in a scientific field, will keep people linking to you in various ways. This will only serve to increase your leads and generate more traffic.<\/li>\n<li>The <a href=\"\/insights\/invest-seo-roi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">long-term ROI you will receive for focusing on SEO<\/a> to get you near the top of a SERP will be invaluable as your business grows.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Before we leave you, congratulations!<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019re more than a little excited about the move to solar.
