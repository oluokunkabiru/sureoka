Rather, we\u2019re about to reveal how, through a carefully executed SEO strategy, you can use your strongest competitors\u2019 strengths to perform better than they do.<\/p>\n<p>Wait? What did we just say? Yes, you heard that right. We\u2019re not about to exploit their weaknesses \u2014 that would be too easy. We\u2019re looking to their strengths as fodder to outrank them.<\/p>\n<p>And don\u2019t let those feelings of guilt come knocking. Essentially, by using their best attributes to rank higher than they do, you are paying them a well-earned compliment (and surging ahead of them in the process.)<\/p>\n<p>Have we piqued your interest? Let\u2019s dive in.<\/p>\n<h2>The Importance of Competitor Research for SEO<\/h2>\n<p>Of course, there\u2019s no way you\u2019ll even be able to identify who your competitors are if you don\u2019t do the necessary research. In fact, competitor research should be one of your very first tasks when it comes to implementing your SEO strategy.<\/p>\n<p>While understanding your competitors is instrumental to any marketing endeavour, when it comes to SEO, it couldn\u2019t be more pressing. Not only does it give you a clear idea of the business landscape you are in, but it also allows you to pinpoint strategies that are working \u2014 as well as the ones that are falling flat. These findings can quickly help you construct a blueprint for your own way forward that is well informed by the current climate. (Sounds a whole lot better than shooting in the dark, doesn\u2019t it?)<\/p>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t gone down the path of competitor research yet, here are the stepping stones to help you on your journey.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>STEP 1: Unmask your competitors<\/strong> using a tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SEMRush<\/a>. Within a matter of moments, by simply entering your domain name, you will have a full report of who\u2019s batting on your turf.<\/li>\n<li><strong>STEP 2: Discover what keywords they\u2019re ranking for<\/strong>. Yes, that\u2019s one of the many delicious perks of the internet \u2014 all of that information is right there for you to see. Again, using a tool like SEMRush or <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/?irgwc=1&amp;clickid=wPDTJ7z5xzPwW9syGUTftwa5Ukg2P%3ARBTRP%3AyI0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ahrefs<\/a> will make this task very easy.<\/li>\n<li><strong>STEP 3: Analyze their site construction<\/strong>.

Mwahahahahahaha<\/p>\n<p>This is how to use your competitors\u2019 strengths against them so that you can outrank them.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Window shop for content ideas<\/h3>\n<p>You know the saying, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery \u2014 and now is the time to lay on the charm. Particularly if your digital marketing strategy is fresh out of the box, you are going to need to create oodles of content to drive your SEO campaign. By browsing your competitors\u2019 sites for content that ranks in the upper echelons, you will get ideas for how to construct your own. Who knows what ideas their ideas might spark in you?<\/p>\n<p>(I\u2019m sure we don\u2019t have to tell you that under absolutely no circumstances whatsoever should you ever, ever plagiarize. That\u2019s boring. And illegal. But getting inspired by the ideas of others? People have been doing that as long as we\u2019ve been people.)<\/p>\n<h3>2. Woo their followers<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, woo their followers like you\u2019re the pied piper and it\u2019s time to play your song. Where is the best place to find these groupies? In the most communal corners of the internet, of course. You guessed it \u2014 social media. By finding their followers, you will know who you should be reaching out to with your own content. Look at that! Your customer avatars are transformed into living, breathing human beings.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Browse their links<\/h3>\n<p>If your competitors are particularly good link builders, you can learn a lot from their strategies. By using a tool like Monitor Backlinks, you can quickly identify how far their network of links goes. From this point, you can decide whether to imitate their structure or create your own based on what you feel has worked best for them.<\/p>\n<h3>4. Become their friends<\/h3>\n<p>We thought that one might confuse you. Look, competitors is no longer a swear word in the business world. In fact, in the world of SEO, a competitor can quickly become more ally than foe. Now this methodology won\u2019t work for everyone, but in specific cases, you might want to create a direct relationship with them when it comes to your content strategy. Perhaps you can come to an agreement where you guest post for each other, simultaneously growing your respective reach.<\/p>\n<p>Look, before you start to think we\u2019ve gone all soft on you, know that you can also use their weaknesses against them. By monitoring their strategy implementation, you can give yourself the gift of somebody else\u2019s hindsight and ensure that you do not repeat their mistakes.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll never believe this, but competitor sleuthing is one of the fun activities that gets us out of bed in the mornings. So if you\u2019re looking to gain more insight into your own SEO strategy, why not have a free strategy review call with us today?<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ll get our team on board with your team, as we work toward Search Engine domination.
