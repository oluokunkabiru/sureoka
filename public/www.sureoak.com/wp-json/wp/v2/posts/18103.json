another. \u00a0More importantly for SEO purposes, <a href=\"\/insights\/link-building-strategy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">backlinks<\/a> have a natural and inherent SEO value as search engines like Google have used backlinks for over 2 decades to understand the relative value of webpages and websites.<\/p>\n<p>The purpose of this guide is to share with you the best practices for interlinking (internal linking) the pages on your website to help you <a href=\"\/insights\/seo-best-practices-techniques-podcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">optimize your website for SEO<\/a>, clicks, and helpfulness to the reader. \u00a0You want to capitalize on the power of cross-linking pages on your website since it is directly within your control and will help to rank other webpages higher in the search results when someone searches on Google.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"best-practices\">Best Practices for Interlinking<\/h2>\n<h3 id=\"natural\">Natural<\/h3>\n<p>You will find that the recurring theme of all the best practices here for backlinking is that everything should be done \u201cnaturally\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t follow a pattern. \u00a0If you keep reusing the same formula to add backlinks, this can appear suspicious to Google and hurt your site from ranking. \u00a0Google\u2019s algorithms <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/66356?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">detect and penalize<\/a> intentional efforts to manipulate ranking in search results (SEO). \u00a0Search engines want to rank pages that best meet the searcher\u2019s query, not sites that are trying to \u201cgame the algorithm\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Google is very sensitive to any unnatural backlinking, as <a href=\"\/insights\/google-algorithm-updates-podcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">their algorithm<\/a> can detect spam signals or attempts to manipulate their search engine.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"relevant-helpful\">Relevant and Helpful<\/h3>\n<p>Be sure that all interlinking that you do within your blog post would be considered natural and normal for human beings. \u00a0A hyperlink should make sense for why a reader would want to go there.<\/p>\n<p>Backlinks should be created with readers in mind and help them to find other relevant and related web pages as a reference. \u00a0Consider your reader\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sureoak.com\/insights\/improved-customer-experience-podcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">user experience<\/a> as you add in the link. Would the reader find value or at least understand the connection made through this link? If yes, link. If not, don\u2019t force the link.<\/p>\n<p>Backlinks should be \u201ccontextually relevant\u201d. \u00a0For example, if you were writing about the challenges of programming with Python, you wouldn\u2019t link to a web page about the history of tennis. \u00a0Almost all backlinks created should be related to web pages they are cross-linking to (as much as possible)\u00a0and help the reader find out and learn more about what is being discussed in that text. \u00a0We should not be forcing backlinks into text or \u201cmaking up excuses\u201d to try to get them into text, but links can be \u201ccreatively\u201d included by adding a paragraph or a phrase that might create an opportunity to link to a high-priority page.<\/p>\n<p>If a blog post is primarily about searching for wedding shoes, then it would be normal and natural for there to be several natural links to the page about wedding shoes on your website. \u00a0If a blog post is about baseball cards, then no, it would not make sense to link from that page to your page about wedding shoes (unless your site is naturally eclectic and about varied topics).<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"anchor-text\">Anchor Text<\/h3>\n<p>Anchor text is <a href=\"#\">the highlighted blue text <\/a>(&lt;&#8212;- THIS ) that indicates to users that the text is a clickable link. \u00a0It is the visible and clickable text of a hyperlink.<\/p>\n<p>For example, the anchor text of this HTML code is \u201cGoogle\u201d:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google<\/a><\/p>\n<p>And the text will appear like this: \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Be sure to use normal and natural anchor text. \u00a0In the past and even today, spammy websites have attempted to manipulate search engines by using \u201cexact match anchor text\u201d. \u00a0This means that if they want to rank a webpage for the keyword \u201cbest running shoes\u201d, they would keep using this exact match anchor text repeatedly like this: \u00a0<a href=\"#\">best running shoes<\/a>. \u00a0(Note: \u00a0We do not want to to do this.)<\/p>\n<p>However, in the natural context of a blog post that you are writing, you might instead write and hyperlink something natural like: \u00a0\u201cIf you are prepping for an upcoming marathon, you may be wondering <a href=\"#\">what shoes will be best for your run<\/a>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It bears repeating: \u00a0Keep your anchor text natural and normal.<\/p>\n<p>Anchor text is discussed again later in this guide.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"number-of-backlinks\">The Number of Backlinks in a Post<\/h3>\n<p>It is impossible to say that there should be an exact number of backlinks in any one blog post. \u00a0We can\u2019t set a hard number of backlinks to aim for, nor can we say any specific range of how many backlinks to put in a blog post. \u00a0Again, just keep it natural and do what makes sense. Generally speaking, we might see a bell curve where the majority of blog posts have around 3-10 backlinks in each post. \u00a0But there might be a rare post where no backlink would make sense or a post where 10+ backlinks make sense.<\/p>\n<p>Just be careful not to \u201coverdo\u201d it and aggressively create too many backlinks. \u00a0At the same time, we shouldn\u2019t be reluctant to backlink either. Ultimately, we want to strike the right balance.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"external-vs-internal\">External vs Internal Mix of Backlinks<\/h2>\n<p>We want (you guessed it!) a natural mix of outgoing backlinks from a blog post to different websites. \u00a0That is to say, we wouldn\u2019t keep linking to the same web page 10 times in one post unless of course, it absolutely made sense to. \u00a0Generally speaking, there should be a mix.<\/p>\n<p>Some links will be \u201cinternal\u201d (to the same pages on the website) and some will be \u201cexternal\u201d (to pages on other websites). \u00a0There is no exact ratio of a mix that we need to abide by, but most naturally, there would typically be a mix<\/p>\n<p>For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>blog post #1\u2019s links are 80% internal and 20% external<\/li>\n<li>blog post #2\u2019s links are 50% internal and 50% external<\/li>\n<li>blog post #3\u2019s links are 20% internal and 80% external<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Again, there is no set rule here, but we should just have a natural mix and natural variation.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"linking-specific-pages\">Linking to Specific Pages<\/h2>\n<p>As an example, if we would like to help rank the webpage <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Love\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Love<\/a> for the keyword \u201clove\u201d in Google, then we will want to have more inner links going to this webpage. \u00a0This will indicate to Google that it is a more valuable webpage.<\/p>\n<p>However, we do not want to use the same exact match anchor text repeatedly.<\/p>\n<p>We also don\u2019t want to inner link to this webpage too many times. \u00a0For example, if we linked to this one page 50 times, this might seem a little suspicious to Google. \u00a0Perhaps a maximum of around 10 links to a specific page like this from various blog posts will be all that is needed. \u00a0(Note, on the other hand, that it could be very natural to link to the same webpage 100 or more times. \u00a0You must use your discretion.)<\/p>\n<p>We also don\u2019t want to link too many times to pages in any one post, unless of course, it makes sense to. \u00a0Perhaps if we link to a page once or twice (or a few times maximum) in some blog posts, this would make sense. \u00a0If one blog post was linking to pages too much, it can become a major concern.<\/p>\n<p>It is also important to consider that if we keep backlinking to the same page over and over, it will eventually lose its \u201cpotency.\u201d \u00a0In other words, the first few times that we backlink to a webpage it will have a more significant effect. By the 10th time, it won\u2019t have as much of an effect. \u00a0By the 50th time, it will have hardly any effect. There is a \u201cpoint of diminishing returns.\u201d This is also something worth bearing in mind.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"when-writing\">When Writing<\/h2>\n<p>If we know that we want to create more backlinks to certain pages, it will make sense to take this into consideration while you begin developing your blog post. \u00a0For example, there might be a point in the blog post where it can make sense to mention a certain keyword, and so you might include a phrase, sentence, or paragraph that will create a cross-linking opportunity within the blog post. \u00a0As you already know, it simply has to be natural, relevant, and a good user experience.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"seo-backlinking\">SEO and Backlinking<\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/learn\/seo\/backlinks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Backlinks<\/a> are very important for <a href=\"\/insights\/seo-top-ranking-factors\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SEO<\/a> because this is how Google calculates the importance of different websites and webpages so that they can show users the best search results when someone does a Google search. \u00a0Google and other search engines like Bing use backlinks as the most heavily-weighted ranking factor in their algorithm to show the best search results to their users. For example, if The New York Times links to another website, Google will give a lot of weighting to that webpage being linked to since it is coming from such an authoritative and credible source. \u00a0Generally speaking, the more high-quality backlinks that a webpage and website have, the higher it will rank in the search results pages on Google.<\/p>\n<p>Google used to use a metric called \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/PageRank\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">PageRank<\/a>\u201d to determine the importance of webpages and websites from the backlinks coming to them. \u00a0They still continue to use similar metrics like PageRank today. <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/70897?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google actively \u201ccrawls\u201d billions of pages<\/a> on the web and \u201csees\u201d all of these backlinks and how all webpages are connected to each other.<\/p>\n<p>Over time Google has had to fight a lot of spam of people trying to <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/66356?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">manipulate their rankings with backlinks and anchor text<\/a>; this is why natural and proper linking is a sensitive undertaking.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"link-equity\">Link Equity<\/h2>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-link-equity\">What is Link Equity?<\/h3>\n<p>Link equity is the amount of authority a link passes from one page to another. \u00a0Link equity is determined by several different factors, including how many backlinks are coming to that page<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">For example, a page with a lot of external backlinks coming to it will pass a lot of link equity, or SEO juice, to any webpage that is linked to from this webpage (as opposed to a webpage that has 0 backlinks coming to it). There are of course other factors in which <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/learn\/seo\/what-is-link-equity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SEO juice<\/a> is determined.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8220;Link equity, also known as \u201clink juice\u201d, is a search engine ranking factor based on the idea that certain links pass value and authority from one page to another. This value is dependent on a number of factors, such as the linking page\u2019s authority, topical relevance, HTTP status, and more. Links that pass equity are one of many signals that Google and other search engines use to determine a page&#8217;s rankings in the SERPs.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"how-is-link-equity-determined\">How Link Equity Is Determined<\/h2>\n<p>Here are some of the factors that influence SEO juice:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Relevancy\n<ul>\n<li>Only add links that are relevant and related to the blog post content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>DoFollow vs NoFollow\n<ul>\n<li>Followed links will pass link equity but nofollow links will pass either none or very close to none. \u00a0If you don\u2019t indicate whether a link is dofollow or nofollow, it is by default dofollow. To make a link nofollow, you would add the HTML attribute rel=&#8221;nofollow\u2019 to the link tag. \u00a0See more below.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Location\n<ul>\n<li>The location of where the link is on the page is important.<\/li>\n<li>Links that are coming from the sidebar or footer will carry very little link equity.<\/li>\n<li>Links that are coming from within the content carry more equity, often referred to as \u201ceditorial links.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Links that are closer towards the top of the page typically carry more weight for search engines (Google) than links that appear near the bottom of the page.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of Links\n<ul>\n<li>A blog post that has 2 backlinks will carry more weight to those 2 pages than a blog post that has 10 backlinks. \u00a0The blog post with 10 backlinks will \u201cdivide up\u201d the link equity across more links (like a limited resource).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"additional-concepts\">Additional Concepts<\/h2>\n<h3 id=\"internal-vs-external-backlinks\">Internal vs External Backlinks<\/h3>\n<h4 id=\"internal-links\">Internal Backlinks<\/h4>\n<p>An internal backlink is a link from one page of a website that is linking to another page of the same website.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a link from a blog post on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zappos.com\/beyondthebox\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/www.zappos.com\/beyondthebox\/<\/a> to another blog post on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zappos.com\/beyondthebox\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/www.zappos.com\/beyondthebox\/<\/a> is an internal backlink.<\/p>\n<h4 id=\"external-links\">External Backlinks<\/h4>\n<p>An external backlink is a link from one page of a website that is linking to another page of a different website.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a link from a blog post on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.indeed.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">indeed.com<\/a> to a job post on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.zappos.com\/beyondthebox\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/www.zappos.com\/beyondthebox\/<\/a> is an external backlink.<\/p>\n<p>For a second example, a link from a blog post on https:\/\/www.zappos.com\/beyondthebox\/ to a page on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shoes.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/www.shoes.com\/<\/a> is an external backlink.<\/p>\n<p>When linking out to other external websites, make sure that they are high-quality websites.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"nofollow-links\">Nofollow Links<\/h3>\n<p>A \u201cnofollow\u201d link tells Google not to pass any link equity to that page being linked to. \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/96569?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google explains it here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>You can learn more about nofollow links <a href=\"https:\/\/www.shoutmeloud.com\/understand-dofollow-nofollow-link-seo-basics.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/07\/24\/follow-nofollow-links\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you ever wanted to not pass link equity to another webpage or website with your backlink, or you were not confident that the site you were linking to is a high-quality website, you could decide to use a \u201cnofollow\u201d backlink.<\/p>\n<p>(You are discouraged from linking out to low-quality websites anyway as it will reflect negatively on your own domain.)<\/p>\n<p>A nofollow link is created by adding rel=\u2019nofollow\u2019 into the a href tag in the HTML:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener \u201cnofollow\u201d noreferrer\">Google<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Using a nofollow link this way, users can still click and follow your link, but Google won\u2019t count any link equity towards that webpage it is linking to.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"open-new-tab\">Open in a New Tab<\/h3>\n<p>When adding backlinks, <a href=\"https:\/\/allyssabarnes.com\/open-external-links-new-tab\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">we prefer to check the box in WordPress<\/a> that says \u201cOpen link in a new tab.\u201d \u00a0This allows the user to come back to the primary page they were reading, while temporarily viewing the new page they have just opened. \u00a0Thus, they can stay on your website for longer or return back to it when they\u2019re done with the other page.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"anchor-text\">Anchor Text<\/h3>\n<p>See above for a brief overview of what anchor text is.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"spam-vs-natural\">Spam vs Natural<\/h3>\n<p>Historically, Google has sensitivity to anchor text because it has been manipulated over the years by unscrupulous SEOs looking to \u201cgame the system\u201d. \u00a0For example, if we wanted to rank this page <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Love\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Love<\/a> for the keyword \u201clove\u201d, using the \u201cexact match anchor text\u201d of the keyword as the anchor text used to help indicate to Google that this page is a good search result for this keyword, love. \u00a0But if we used this exact same anchor text 100% of the time we link to this page or even 20% of the time we linked to this page, it would indicate to Google that we are trying to \u201cmanipulate\u201d their algorithm, and it would count against us.<\/p>\n<p>From a <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/anchor-text\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">data-driven study by Ahrefs<\/a>, one researcher concluded the following:<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">&#8220;I would suggest exact match at around 2% and phrase match at around 30% will keep you on the right side of Google.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">What this means is that from our previous example, if we are linking to the page about \u201crunning shoes\u201d, we might use that exact match anchor text almost never, and use a \u201cphrase match\u201d or \u201cpartial match\u201d about 30% of the time. \u00a0And the other 70% of the time we\u2019d use all kinds of other types of anchor text. An example of a partial match is \u201cnew running shoes\u201d or \u201ccomfortable running shoes.\u201d Use variations of those keywords.
