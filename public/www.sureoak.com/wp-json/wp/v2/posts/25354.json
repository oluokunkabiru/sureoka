So, while this wasn&#8217;t a huge concern for us, the competitor&#8217;s massive plummet piqued our interest enough to poke around.<\/p>\n<p>As far as we could tell, the competitor hadn&#8217;t done anything new to their website.<\/p>\n<p>Their site wasn&#8217;t hacked, they didn&#8217;t migrate to a new domain, and they didn&#8217;t lose a significant number of backlinks. And yet, in a matter of 24 hours, their search traffic had dropped by nearly 50%.<\/p>\n<p>For a brief moment, we were completely puzzled. What was going on to cause such a dramatic drop in our competitor&#8217;s search rankings?<\/p>\n<p>About ten minutes later, the culprit hit us like a ton of bricks.<\/p>\n<p>No, this competitor didn&#8217;t make a giant, glaring error on their website. From the looks of things, they hadn&#8217;t even <i>touched <\/i>the website for 2 weeks!<\/p>\n<p>Their downfall came right after Google updated their algorithm.<\/p>\n<p>To be clear, Google is <i>constantly<\/i> updating their algorithm in the background; and much of this activity goes unnoticed.<\/p>\n<p>But this update was different in that it was a core algorithm update\u2014one of the biggest updates we&#8217;ll see all year.<\/p>\n<p>But still, what did this algorithm update do to make our competitor&#8217;s rankings nosedive, while our client&#8217;s rankings remained largely intact?<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get the answer straight from the horse&#8217;s mouth, shall we?<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what Google posted on Twitter on January 13, 2020.<\/p>\n<\/div><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Later today, we are releasing a broad core algorithm update, as we do several times per year. It is called the January 2020 Core Update. Our guidance about such updates remains as we\u2019ve covered before. Please see this blog post for more about that:<a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/e5ZQUA3RC6\">https:\/\/t.co\/e5ZQUA3RC6<\/a><\/p>\u2014 Google SearchLiaison (@searchliaison) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/searchliaison\/status\/1216752087515586560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 13, 2020<\/a><\/blockquote> <script async src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script><div class=\"fusion-text fusion-text-2\"><p>Although they didn&#8217;t provide specifics about this update (which is par for the course at SEO-land), they <i>did <\/i>link to a post called &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/webmasters.googleblog.com\/2019\/08\/core-updates.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What webmasters should know about Google&#8217;s core updates<\/a>&#8221; which gives us a lot of really good insights on what Google is trying to accomplish.<\/p>\n<h2>Google&#8217;s New Age<\/h2>\n<p>Just a few years ago, most of us in the SEO space held the belief that Google&#8217;s algorithm was getting smarter, and thus increasing in its ability to read content like a human.<\/p>\n<p>While we weren&#8217;t wrong about the algorithm getting smarter, we <i>were <\/i>a bit mistaken on <i>how <\/i>it would get smarter.<\/p>\n<p>For more than a decade, Google has contracted with over 10,000 &#8220;Search Quality Raters.&#8221; As part of their line of duty, these human employees are tasked to test the quality of Google&#8217;s search results.<\/p>\n<p>Though Google&#8217;s Quality Raters don&#8217;t affect search rankings directly, they <i>do <\/i>give the algorithm a benchmark standard for what a searcher wants to see.<\/p>\n<p>We thought that Google would rely on their human Quality Raters less and less as the Google AI learns more about the web. But in 2020, Google actually relies on their human input <i>more than ever.<\/i><\/p>\n<h3>The YMYL Police<\/h3>\n<p>According to their most recent <a href=\"https:\/\/static.googleusercontent.com\/media\/guidelines.raterhub.com\/en\/\/searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">guidelines<\/a>, Google holds certain webpages to a higher standard than others. These pages are known by the acronym &#8220;YMYL,&#8221; which stands for &#8220;your money, your life.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>According to Google, YMYL pages are those that can have an impact on your happiness, health, financial stability, or safety.<\/p>\n<p>If a YMYL website contains false or misleading information, it could end up causing harm to the reader. Google&#8217;s goal is to minimize this harm as much as possible.<\/p>\n<p>So when quality raters are presented with a page about health, wellness, or finances, they rate that page with a stricter set of standards than they would normally use.<\/p>\n<\/div><div class=\"imageframe-align-center\"><span class=\" fusion-imageframe imageframe-none imageframe-1 hover-type-none img-margin-bot\" style=\"max-width:80%;\"><img width=\"400\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Google Quality Rater Guidelines\" title=\"google-quality-rater-guidelines\" src=\"https:\/\/www.sureoak.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/google-quality-rater-guidelines.png\" data-orig-src=\"https:\/\/www.sureoak.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/google-quality-rater-guidelines.png\" class=\"lazyload img-responsive wp-image-25355\" srcset=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%27400%27%20height%3D%27600%27%20viewBox%3D%270%200%20400%20600%27%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%27400%27%20height%3D%27600%27%20fill-opacity%3D%220%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E\" data-srcset=\"https:\/\/www.sureoak.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/google-quality-rater-guidelines-200x300.png 200w, https:\/\/www.sureoak.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/google-quality-rater-guidelines.png 400w\" data-sizes=\"auto\" data-orig-sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 400px\" \/><\/span><\/div><div class=\"fusion-text fusion-text-3\"><p>So what&#8217;s this mean for you? <b>If your business focuses on happiness, health, or wealth, your search rankings could come crashing down at a moment&#8217;s notice\u2014just like our competitor&#8217;s.<\/b><\/p>\n<h2>How to Avoid A Ranking Drop<\/h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re like us, the idea of losing half of your search traffic is a scary thought.<\/p>\n<p>According to Google, &#8220;there&#8217;s nothing wrong&#8221; with pages that lose rankings after a core algorithm update. While this might be technically true, that answer isn&#8217;t good enough for us as an SEO agency.<\/p>\n<p>Google updates their algorithm on a regular basis.
