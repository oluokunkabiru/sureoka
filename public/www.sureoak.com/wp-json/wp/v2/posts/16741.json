If it is not already, an effective SEO strategy should be right at the top of your company\u2019s To Do list if you are looking for measurable, sustainable growth.<\/p>\n<p>But there\u2019s no need to take our word for it \u2014 let\u2019s turn our attention to the stats. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/marketing-statistics?__hstc=191390709.28e6086c8c4bf0b74d42e10b8d4597ce.1538504862663.1538504862663.1538504862663.1&amp;__hssc=191390709.1.1538504862663&amp;__hsfp=3878817923\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">61% of marketers say that growing an organic presence is their Number 1 marketing priority.<\/a> Yes, it is that important.<\/p>\n<p>While you may know that you need to optimize your site to herald in the Age of the Great Flock of Converting Customers, how you achieve that steady rush is more elusive, and here\u2019s why:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>SEO is a slow, steady process that prioritizes long-term growth over short bursts of unsustainable results. It often takes patience to see the results you desire. In a time when we are conditioned for convenience and the quick fix, SEO offers a different temporal landscape \u2014 one that embodies the saying, \u201cSlow and steady wins the race.\u201d<\/li>\n<li>The rules of SEO are changing all the time. It may feel as though as soon as you think you\u2019ve got with the program, the program changes.<\/li>\n<li>The sheer weight of competition for your most prized keywords might be crushing your determination to even attempt to rise to the top.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Yes, getting SEO right can be tough \u2014 so much so that you may want to throw in the towel on numerous occasions.<\/p>\n<p>But we\u2019ve always found defeat rather boring, so enough of that.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s time to wipe those tears of sweat and pain from your ducts because we\u2019re here to share a few secrets with you that will allow you to improve your site, and fast.<\/p>\n<p>While we don\u2019t want to pretend that you do not need a long-term approach to see genuine results, there are 3 things that you can do today to give your strategy a makeover and get you prepped for sustainable growth.<\/p>\n<h2>1. Put your customers first<\/h2>\n<p>User experience is right at the top of Google\u2019s priority list.<\/p>\n<p>Think of it from their perspective. Their goal, as stated in their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/about\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">mission statement<\/a>, \u201cis to organize the world\u2019s information and make it universally accessible and useful.\u201d To do that, they have to make sure they have the best information available to respond to the queries people make on their platform. Their first responsibility is to anyone who dares to type a query in that search box.<\/p>\n<p>UX is their El Dorado, as it should be for anyone interested in growth and marketing. For SEO purposes, your job is to provide valuable answers to the questions people are asking that relate to your business. Not only do you have to answer those questions, but you should do so in a way that makes users want to stick around (and come back) for more answers from you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s your hack strategy:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Provide content that is genuinely useful to people.<\/strong> Don\u2019t just generate content with lots of keywords in it because you feel like you must. Think of your content as answering the questions they are asking. It\u2019s a dialogue. Want to see how your content ranks? Analyze your site for Content and four other SEO tools in our free <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sureoak.com\/tools\/seo-checker-analysis-tool\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SEO Score Tool<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Boost the speed of your site.<\/strong> Page load speed has been one of the key priorities for Google ranking for some time, simply because people will not stick around if it\u2019s too slow. Here\u2019s a fun fact \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.compass.co\/page-load-time-how-page-speed-boost-revenue\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bounce rate increases by up to 50% if a page takes an extra 2 seconds to load<\/a>. Get your page up to speed. Not sure how to measure your page speed?<\/li>\n<li><strong>Optimize for mobile.<\/strong> Your customers are going mobile. <a href=\"https:\/\/webmasters.googleblog.com\/2018\/03\/rolling-out-mobile-first-indexing.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">So is Google<\/a>. So should you.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>2. Go for all natural language<\/h3>\n<p>Now you can approach your language like you do your supermarket cart \u2014 choose what\u2019s natural. Why is this important? Simply because the way in which people search is changing.<\/p>\n<p>When our little species was first getting used to search engines, we would interact with them as we would a library catalog, inputting statements such as \u201cImmediate Wart Removal.\u201d As time has progressed, we have come to see our search engines more like our trusted friends. Now, we are more likely to type, \u201cHow do I remove a wart as quickly as possible?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Using natural language in your SEO strategy is part of a move toward what is known as <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/what-is-semantic-search\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Semantic Search<\/a>, that prioritizes user intent over specific keywords. While keywords are of course still vital to SEO, how you research and use them is changing.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s your hack strategy:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Include target question words such as \u201cHow,\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d and \u201cWhere\u201d in your keyword research.<\/li>\n<li>Create content in natural language. Write as if you are responding to a friend.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>3. Get rich with featured snippets<\/h3>\n<p>We\u2019ve saved one of our favourites for last. A featured snippet (or rich answer as it is sometimes referred to) is the little text box that comes up at the top of a search engine results page. It\u2019s essentially Google giving a major thumbs up to a piece of content that it sees as the definitive answer to a query. It\u2019s not difficult to see how this would boost both your visibility and credibility. This is not about getting to the top. It\u2019s about getting above the top.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example:<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"lazyload aligncenter size-600 wp-image-16743\" src=\"data:image\/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%27http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%27%20width%3D%27600%27%20height%3D%27327%27%20viewBox%3D%270%200%20600%20327%27%3E%3Crect%20width%3D%27600%27%20height%3D%27327%27%20fill-opacity%3D%220%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E\" data-orig-src=\"https:\/\/www.sureoak.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/crawling-indexing-600x327.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"327\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Alright, you got us. That is indeed our content, and yes, we are showing it off like proud parents.<\/p>\n<p>But we like you. So we\u2019re willing to share how we did it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s your hack strategy:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We won\u2019t lie \u2014 this is a difficult one. There is no clear literature on what the criteria are for reaching this spot.<\/p>\n<p>From our own tireless process of trial and error, here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learnt:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use what\u2019s working. Find terms you are already ranking for and bolster them.<\/li>\n<li>Think of a question related to your industry that people will be asking a search engine.<\/li>\n<li>Now make that question simpler.<\/li>\n<li>Now make it even simpler.<\/li>\n<li>At this point, it should be as clear as \u201cWhat is the difference between crawling and indexing?\u201d<\/li>\n<li>Now create a response that succinctly answers the question. As with your question, use the K.I.S.S. rule with your answer \u2014 Keep It Simple, Stupid. You can go into more detail in the rest of the content piece, but the opening has to be an exact, easy-to-understand answer to the question that is being asked.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>To conclude<\/h2>\n<p>At the basis of all our hacks is a simple hint \u2014 be useful.<\/p>\n<p>This is why we love SEO.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than creating advertising that spams people out of their happy space, SEO provides a marketing opportunity where you and your customers get to experience the value you bring to the world.<\/p>\n<p>Ready?
