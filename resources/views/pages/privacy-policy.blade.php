										<h4>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h4>
										<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require
											commercial websites and online services to post a privacy
											policy. The law&#8217;s reach stretches well beyond California
											to require any person or company in the United States (and
											conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting
											Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to
											post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly
											the information being collected and those individuals or
											companies with whom it is being shared. &#8211; See more at: <a
												href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a>
										</p>
										<h4>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</h4>
										<p>Users can visit our site anonymously.</p>
										<p>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on
											our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page
											after entering our website.</p>
										<p>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word &#8216;Privacy&#8217;
											and can easily be found on the page specified above.</p>
										<p>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:<br /> • On
											our Privacy Policy Page<br /> Can change your personal
											information:<br /> • By emailing us</p>
										<h4>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</h4>
										<p>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or
											use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is
											in place.</p>
										<h4>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h4>
										<p>It&#8217;s also important to note that we allow third-party
											behavioral tracking</p>
										<h4>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h4>
										<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from
											children under the age of 13 years old, the Children&#8217;s
											Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control.
											The Federal Trade Commission, United States&#8217; consumer
											protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out
											what operators of websites and online services must do to
											protect children&#8217;s privacy and safety online.</p>
										<p>We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13
											years old.</p>
										<h4>Fair Information Practices</h4>
										<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of
											privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include
											have played a significant role in the development of data
											protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair
											Information Practice Principles and how they should be
											implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws
											that protect personal information.</p>
										<p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will
											take the following responsive action, should a data breach
											occur:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>We will notify you via email</li>
											<li>We will notify the users via in-site notification</li>
											<li>Within 7 business days</li>
										</ul>
										<p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires
											that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable
											rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere
											to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals
											have enforceable rights against data users, but also that
											individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to
											investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
										</p>
										<h4>CAN SPAM Act</h4>
										<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial
											email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives
											recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to
											them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
										<p>We collect your email address in order to:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other
												requests or questions</li>
											<li>Process orders and to send information and updates
												pertaining to orders.</li>
											<li>Send you additional information related to your product
												and/or service</li>
											<li>Market to our mailing list or continue to send emails to our
												clients after the original transaction has occurred.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</p>
										<ul>
